## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar brings together students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC to develop software skills for science.

### Winter 2023 Mathematical Modelling

Our theme for the semester is *Mathematical Modelling*. Interpret this anyway you like! *Everyone is invited!*

Our seminar meets every **Friday 11-12pm**. Please join the [UBCS3 mailing list](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6VCa1EYL5xjlUQ5) to receive weekly updates.
